# Synthetic 911 Data Generator
 Synthetic Data Generator for 911 call center data

This is a generator to create synthetic data for presentation purposes. 
I give several presentations throughout the year on using statstics in 911 centers. However, I do not want to expose actual 911 calls to the public. This generator will create synthetic data that can be used in place of actual data.
